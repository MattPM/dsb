#' \describe {
#' cells_citeseq_mtx is a matrix of cells as columns and 87 proteins as rows. It is a random even distribution of cells manually annotated from protein clustering of maximum of 100 cells per cluster ( on 30 clusters). Full celltype data annotations and more information is available in the referenced publication.
