Description: dsb (denoised and scaled by background) is a lightweight R package for normalizing and denoising protein expression data from droplet based single cell experiments. Raw protein counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibodies in droplets (e.g. CITE-seq) have substantial measurement noise. Our experiments and computational modeling revealed two major components of this noise: 1) protein-specific noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that can be accurately inferred via the expected protein counts detected in empty droplets, and 2) droplet/cell specific noise revealed via the shared variance component associated with isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each cell. The dsb package normalizes raw protein data from these experiments, removing both of these sources of noise. The package can be used to normalize data from methods such as CITE-seq, REAP-seq, and data from Mission Bio Tapestri platform. See the Readme/vignette for tutorials and how to integrate dsb with Seurat, Bioconductor and Python’s AnnData class. Please see our BioRxiv preprint for more details on the dsb method. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.963603v1
