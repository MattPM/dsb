Description: The dsb package (denoised and scaled by background) is a lightweight R package for normalizing and denoising protein expression data from droplet based single cell genomics experiments. Raw protein counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibodies in droplets (e.g. CITE-seq) have substantial noise. Our experiments and computational modeling revealed two major components of protein expression noise in droplet-based single cell analysis: 1) protein-specific noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that can be accurately inferred via the expected protein counts detected in empty droplets, and 2) droplet/cell specific noise revealed via the shared variance component associated with isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each cell. The dsb package normalizes raw protein data from these experiments, removing both of these sources of noise. The dsb package can be applied to protein data from single cell methods such as CITE-seq, REAP-seq, and data from Mission Bio Tapestri platform.
