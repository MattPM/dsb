Description: dsb (denoised and scaled by background) is a lightweight R package for normalizing and denoising protein expression data from droplet based single cell genomics experiments. Protein data from sequencing antibody conjugated oligos in droplets (e.g. CITE-seq) suffers from substantial noise of unknown origin.  Through control experiments and computational modeling designed to pinpoint the sources of this noise, we developed and validated a low level normalization method for this new type of data, dsb. The dsb package removes protein-level noise by leveraging counts in empty droplets and and removes technical cell to cell variations by defining and removing each cell's 'technical component' which we define as the primary latent component of isotype control and each cell's background proteins derived from a per-cell Gaussian Mixture. dsb can be applied to single cell methods such as CITE-seq, REAP-seq, and Mission Bio Tapestri.
